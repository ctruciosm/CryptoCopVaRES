# CryptoCopVaRES

The dataset as well as the codes used to estimate the VaR and the ES in the paper of Trucíos et al. (2020) are made available to the community with reproducible purposes. 

After the publication of the paper, I submitted the R package **RobGARCHBoot** (Trucíos, 2020) where the robust GARCH estimator used in the paper is implemented (I did some improvements in the optimization of the robust procedure, so the results could be not exactly equal as in the paper but qualitatively the results should be the same)
